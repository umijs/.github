<p align="center">Extensible enterprise-level front-end application framework.</p>

[Umi](https://github.com/umijs/umi), pronounced as "‰πåÁ±≥", is an extensible enterprise-level front-end application framework. Umi is based on routing and supports both configuration-based routing and convention-based routing to ensure complete routing functionality, which can be extended with this foundation. It is accompanied by a plugin system with comprehensive lifecycle management that covers every stage from source code to build artifacts, supporting various functional extensions and business requirements.

Umi is the underlying front-end framework of Ant Group and has directly or indirectly served more than 10,000 applications, including Java, Node, H5 wireless, offline (Hybrid) applications, pure front-end assets applications, CMS applications, Electron applications, Serverless applications, and more. It has provided good service to our internal users and also many external users, including Taobao, Feizhu, Alibaba Cloud, ByteDance, Tencent, Koubei, Meituan, and others. According to a survey report by ByteDance in 2021, Umi was the choice of 25.33% of developers surveyed.

## Ecosystem

[Umi](https://github.com/umijs/umi) satisfies different scenarios and business needs by providing mechanisms for plugins and preset. Plugins are used to extend a functionality, while preset are used to extend a category of business. For example, in the process of engineering practice, we publish best practices for common problems encountered in front-end development as various plugins. To make it more convenient for developers to use these plugins, we have combined them together to create [@umijs/max](https://umijs.org/docs/max/introduce). This allows developers to immediately obtain the same development experience as Ant Group's Umi application through scaffolding. Additionally, you can also quickly develop and integrate your own solutions. For example, if you want to support Vue, we can use @umijs/preset-vue, which includes building and runtime related to Vue; if you want to support H5 application types, we can use @umijs/preset-h5 to collect H5-related functions together.
